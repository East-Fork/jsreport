problems (somehow solved): 
- SES_HTML_COMMENT_REJECTED when running docx recipe with students showcase, had to disable the line in the SES
- docx doesnt work because of some hacky code in xmldom => need to require xmldom upfront before lockdown
- html-to-xlsx needs to require unzipper before the lockdown
- chrome needs to require puppeteer at the beginning
- jsrender needs lockdown option overrideTaming: 'severe'
- xlsx, html-to-xlsx needs to use in helpers globalThis instead of  this
- pdfjs parser doesnt work in lockdown so parsing pdf returns empty results => preload pdfjs in worker before lockdown with require('pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js').getDocument(Buffer.from([])).promise.catch(() => {})

todo (top down order):
- all tests should be green
- add all node global objects to Compartment globals
- replace Buffer.allocUnsafe  with Buffer.alloc
- check the compiled exe version
- move the lockdown to the reporter init likely, so it is consistent, now some errors can occur after first render and not before because of lockdown
- EJS doesnt work in lockdown, at least an explanation error should be thrown
- bluebird doesnt work in locdown, we need to write it down to release notes and blog
- SES doesnt write an error that throws from background timer (scripts test) - we can live with it
- perhaps try to "analyze" the errors from SES and write to exception some explanation for developers and what can be done
- system helpers compilation? not must for now
