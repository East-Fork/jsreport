problems: 

- SES_HTML_COMMENT_REJECTED when running docx recipe with students showcase, had to disable the line in the SES
- docx doesnt work because of some hacky code in xmldom => need to require xmldom upfront before lockdown
- html-to-xlsx needs to require unzipper before the lockdown
- chrome needs to require puppeteer at the beginning and work just with dedicated-process so far
- jsrender needs lockdown option overrideTaming: 'severe'
- xlsx, html-to-xlsx needs to use in helpers globalThis instead of  this
- pdfjs parser doesnt work in lockdown so parsing pdf returns empty results => preload pdfjs in worker before lockdown with require('pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js').getDocument(Buffer.from([])).promise.catch(() => {})
- SES is writing something to console what should be disabled, anyway we likely need to fork because of first problem

todo:
- error line numbers
- system helpers compilation
- shape the split for unsafe/safe execution with node vm/SES
- fix tests
- add all node global objects to Compartment globals
